**Mobile Application for Scheduling an Appointment for a Patient with Doctor**
**1.Problem Statement**
Doctors are lifesavers and that is why they shouldnâ€™t be too far from those who need healthcare. With more and more people having the need to seek medical attention, doctors need to make their services accessible and available to their patients. In this time and age where everything and anything can be found on the internet, we need to take advantage of digital tools/channels to enable quick scheduling of appointments.

**Find Doctors Near Your Location with Doctors List Sorted Based on Shortest Distance**
The app will display a list of doctors sorted by proximity to the user's current location.

**Book the Appointment and Receive Confirmation Notification in the App**
Users can book appointments directly through the app and receive immediate confirmation notifications.

**Conflict-Free Scheduling**
The application ensures that there are no conflicting consultations for doctors or patients at the booked time slots.

**Reminder Notification with Driving Directions**
Users will receive a reminder notification one hour before their appointment, including a link to driving directions to the doctor's clinic.
